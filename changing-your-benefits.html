            <p class="editable">While we believe it's important for all employees to have health care coverage, you certainly have the option to waive medical and prescription drug coverage. This may be a good choice if you have coverage through another plan&mdash;such as through your spouse's plan. If your spouse loses coverage due to a layoff, termination or plan cancellation (called a "qualified life event"), you may elect coverage during the year.</p>
            <p class="editable">Other events also allow you to make changes to your election, such as marriage, divorce, and the birth or adoption of a child. The IRS has defined specific qualifying events that can occur during the year, allowing you to make changes to your benefit elections outside of the Annual Enrollment period (usually held in October/November annually).</p>
