        <h1>Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)</h1>
        <p class="editable">The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) is a voluntary program which provides eligible employees the opportunity to buy shares of PayPal Common Stock at a discount from the market price on the Purchase Date. Employees are eligible to contribute between 2% and 10% of their after-tax payroll deductions to purchase shares in this program. The purchase price is calculated on the Purchase Date as 85% of the Fair Market Value on either the first day of the Offering Period or the actual Purchase Date, whichever is the lower.  When the Purchase Period ends, shares are purchased for you using contributions deducted from your paycheck and are deposited into your <a href="https://us.etrade.com/home" target="_blank">E*TRADE Employee Stock Plan Account</a>. You may hold them as a long-term investment or immediately sell them for cash.</p>
        
        <p class="editable">Offering Periods begin each May 1 and November 1, with purchases generally occurring on April 30 and October 31. </p>
          <p class="editable">If you have questions, you can also contact E*TRADE by phone at <strong>800-838-0908</strong>.</p>
