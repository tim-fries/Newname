            <p class="editable">Regular preventive care can help you stay well, catch problems early on and potentially save your life.</p>

            <p class="editable">All of the medical plans cover 100% of eligible, in-network preventive care services like screenings, immunizations and exams. If you use an out-of-network provider, your deductible and out-of-network coinsurance will apply.</p>

            <p class="editable"><strong>Remember: Under the HMOs, you must use an in-network provider to receive any benefits.</strong></p>

            <h2 class="editable">What's the difference between preventive and diagnostic care?</h2>

            <p class="editable">Preventive care is generally precautionary. For example, if your doctor recommends having a colonoscopy because of your age or family history, that's preventive care. But, if your doctor recommends a colonoscopy to investigate symptoms you're having, that's diagnostic care, and your plan cost share will apply.</p>

            <h2 class="editable">Good health is an everyday decision</h2>

            <p class="editable">Besides taking advantage of preventive care at no cost to you, there are other things you can do during the year to help you improve and maintain your health and make the most of your health care benefits and health care dollars.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Change unhealthy habits.</li>
              <li>Practice wellness and healthy lifestyles to prevent or alleviate medical conditions and illness.</li>
              <li>Know your family history and share it with your doctor.</li>
              <li>Talk with your doctor about generic drugs and use the mail-order pharmacy program.</li>
              <li>Take time to learn about your health.</li>
              <li>Actively manage any chronic conditions.</li>
              <li>Ask questions of providers.</li>
            </ul>
<h2 class="editable">Take advantage of additional free care if you have diabetes</h2>
<p class="editable">If you have diabetes, you can take advantage of additional preventive care services to help manage and improve your health. If you’re enrolled in a UHC medical plan, <em>you won’t pay anything</em> if you see a doctor for care related to your diabetes. And, if you’re enrolled in the dental and vision plans, you can receive an extra dental cleaning <em>and</em> free eye exam every year. </p>
