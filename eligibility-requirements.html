            <p class="editable">The elections you make during your new hire enrollment will remain in effect until December 31, unless you have an IRS-defined qualified life event (see <a target="_blank" href="https://www.paypalbenefits.com/changing-your-benefits.html">Changing your elections</a>) or become ineligible for benefits. Outside of these qualified events, your next opportunity to make changes to your benefits will be during our benefits Annual Enrollment period, which is held in the fall.</p>

							 <p class="editable">As defined below, eligible dependents include your spouse or domestic partner, and child(ren) up to age 26.</p>
            
            <h3 class="editable">Spouse</h3>
            
            <p class="editable">Your dependent is eligible for coverage as a spouse if he or she is a person you're legally married to under the laws of the state in which you live. Legal spouses include same-sex and common-law spouses in states that recognize these marriages.</p>
            
            <h3 class="editable">Domestic partner</h3>
            
            <p class="editable">Domestic partners are eligible for coverage under the Medical, Dental, Vision, Spouse Life, and Accidental Death and Dismemberment plans. Domestic partner expenses generally are not eligible for Flexible Spending Account or Health Savings Account reimbursement. In order for your same- or opposite-sex domestic partner to be eligible for coverage, you and your partner must have met all of these criteria for a period of six months:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Are at least age 18</li>
              <li>Are not legally married to another person or part of another domestic partnership</li>
              <li>Intend to remain each other's sole domestic partner indefinitely</li>
              <li>Reside together at the same principal residence and intend to do so indefinitely</li>
              <li>Are emotionally committed to one another and share joint responsibility for your common welfare and obligations</li>
              <li>Are not related by blood closer than which would prohibit marriage in the state in which you live</li>
              <li>Are mentally competent to enter into contracts</li>
              <li>Have not been in a different domestic partner relationship or marriage within the last six months</li>
              <li>Have been in the current relationship for at least six months</li>
            </ul>
              
              <p class="editable">
Note: The IRS requires that the fair market value for domestic partner coverage is taxable to the employee as imputed income. This means that full cost of individual coverage (for your domestic partner) would be added to your taxable income (imputed income). You will see domestic partner imputed income added to your earnings (to incur the tax liability) and then deducted from your gross pay.
</p>

            <h3 class="editable">Child(ren)</h3>
            
            <p class="editable">Your dependent is eligible for coverage as a child if he or she is any of the below:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Your natural child</li>
              <li>Your stepchild</li>
              <li>Your adopted child or a child placed with you for adoption</li>
              <li>A child for whom you're the court-appointed guardian</li>
              <li>Any child who is your tax-eligible dependent</li>
              <li>Children of enrolled domestic partners</li>
              <li>Children for whom you are responsible to provide health coverage based on a qualified medical child support order (QMCSO)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="editable"><strong>Note: You can cover dependent children until age 26, regardless of student status or other coverage.</strong></p>
